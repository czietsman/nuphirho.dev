## Abstract

Aviation software certification has operationalised three structural requirements for governed software systems since 1992: structured governance linkage between governing specifications and operational evidence, context-bounded validity that triggers revalidation when operational context changes, and an objective evidence architecture that defines what proof means and what makes it sufficient. These requirements appear in DO-178C and DO-330 and are enforced through FAA and EASA certification.

No existing framework requires these structural properties as intrinsic properties of individual AI governance documents. A system prompt, an AGENTS.md file, a governance policy, or a task envelope can be deployed without satisfying any of the three requirements aviation has enforced for three decades. Aviation is the most technically rigorous instance: its standard-setting bodies have acknowledged that their frameworks break down for AI systems, yet none requires these properties of individual governance documents.

Aviation's structural requirements break down at the system level because AI systems are non-deterministic, but remain transferable at the document level: the governance artifact is a static artifact whose structural properties can be evaluated independently of the stochastic system it governs.

The paper maps DO-178C's traceability architecture, DO-330's requalification triggers, and DO-178C's objective evidence requirements onto three structural findings: epoch limits on governance document validity, proof surfaces as the revalidation feedback mechanism, and the absence of structural completeness requirements in AI governance instruments. An empirical companion (arXiv:2604.21090) found that 37% of AI governance documents fall below the structural quality threshold. PromptQ's seven-principle framework operationalises these requirements at the governance document layer.

## 1. Introduction

The problem of specifying software behaviour precisely enough
to verify it is not new. Aviation software certification has
been developing the engineering methodology for this problem
since the publication of DO-178B in 1992 and its successor
DO-178C in 2011. The core requirement is structured governance
linkage: every software requirement must trace forward to a
test objective and backward to a source system requirement.
Extraneous code (code for which no requirement exists) is a certification finding. Undocumented behaviour (behaviour for which no test exists) is a certification finding. The
specification is not a document that describes the software.
It is a first-class artefact whose completeness the software
must be provably derivable from.

AI governance documents have no equivalent requirement. A
system prompt governing an AI agent can specify behaviour
without defining what done looks like, how outputs will be
verified, what the agent may refuse, or when the document's
own authority expires. The document is deployed. The agent
operates. No certification process checks whether the
governing specification is complete.

This paper's primary conceptual move is to relocate the
assurance question. Aviation's structural requirements are
not transferable to AI systems at the system level: the
aviation certification community has itself acknowledged in
the CoDANN and NPA 2025-07 literature that DO-178C breaks
down for non-deterministic AI because behaviour cannot be
traced to requirements the way deterministic code can. The
relocation this paper proposes is not to the AI system but
to the AI governance artifact. The governance document (the system prompt, AGENTS.md file, governance policy, or
task envelope) is a static authorship-time artifact. Its
structural properties can be evaluated, required, and
enforced independently of the stochastic system it governs.
That decoupling is what makes the transfer viable.

The paper examines what aviation certification has required
for thirty years, maps those requirements onto a framework
of three research findings about AI governance document
quality, and identifies the structural gap that separates
the two traditions. The absence of structural completeness
requirements for AI governance documents is indicated across
nine regulated sectors and five language jurisdictions by a
structured regulatory corpus audit of published standards
and guidance instruments; this paper reports the aviation
sector findings in detail.

## 2. Background

### 2.1 DO-178C and structured governance linkage

DO-178C (RTCA, 2011; adopted by FAA via AC 20-115D, July
2017) defines objectives, activities, and evidence
requirements for five levels of software assurance (Design
Assurance Levels DAL A through E). At DAL A (assurance level, applicable to software whose failure could
cause a catastrophic aircraft accident) the standard
requires full bidirectional traceability across four levels
of specification hierarchy: system requirements, high-level
software requirements, low-level software requirements, and
source code.

The traceability requirement has two directions. Forward
traceability: every system requirement must be traceable
through software requirements to source code and to test
cases. Backward traceability: every source code element
must be traceable back to a software requirement, and
every software requirement must be traceable back to a
system requirement. Elements with no upstream requirement
are classified as extraneous code and constitute a
certification finding regardless of whether they function
correctly.

This paper uses "structured governance linkage" rather than
"bidirectional traceability" when describing the transfer of
this principle to natural language governance documents.
The distinction matters. DO-178C's bidirectional traceability
requires formal syntax and deterministic compilation: source
code can be objectively tested against requirements because
code and requirements share a common formal substrate. Natural
language governance documents do not share that substrate. The
transfer this paper proposes is of the structural principle:
that governance claims must be explicitly linked to evidence
of their satisfaction, and that both gaps and extraneous
content must be identifiable. This is not a transfer of the formal verification
machinery. A natural language governance document achieves
structured governance linkage when every claim is traceable
to a verifiable evaluation mechanism and every evaluation
mechanism traces back to an explicit governance claim.

A requirements set is complete under DO-178C when every
downstream artefact is explainable by upstream intent and
every upstream intent is evidenced downstream. This is an
emergent property of the traceability network's structural
closure, not a separately measurable attribute of individual
requirements.

The quality criteria for requirements under DO-178C are
explicit: requirements must be accurate, unambiguous,
consistent, verifiable, traceable, appropriately detailed,
and free of unintended functionality. These criteria map
onto the seven structural principles of the PromptQ
framework through functional correspondence, not formal
equivalence:

**Table:** *DO-178C requirements criteria mapped to PromptQ principles.*

| DO-178C requirements criterion | PromptQ principle |
|---|---|
| Accurate (describes intended behaviour) | P1 Success Definition |
| Verifiable (provides a checkable criterion) | P2 Assessment Rubric |
| Free of unintended functionality | P3 Scope Boundary |
| Appropriately detailed on data sources | P4 Data Classification |
| Consistent with verification processes | P5 Quality Gate |
| Unambiguous (no multiple valid readings) | P6 Internal Consistency |
| Traceable (bounded to a context) | P7 Contextual Currency |

The mapping is not coincidental. Both frameworks are derived
from the same underlying requirement: that a governance
document must contain the components necessary for a
conforming agent, whether a deterministic software system or an AI language model, to behave correctly,
consistently, and within its currently valid scope.

### 2.2 DO-330 and context-bounded validity

DO-330 (RTCA, 2011) governs the qualification of software
tools used in aviation certification. The DO-330
requalification trigger taxonomy provides a structural
analogy, not a regulatory transplant, for governance
document staleness. The analogy is between the conditions
under which a certification tool loses its qualified status
(and must be re-qualified before continuing to be used in
the certification process) and the conditions under which
a governance document loses its valid status (and must be
revalidated before continuing to govern an AI system). Both
involve artefacts whose continuing validity depends on the
stability of the context for which they were originally
validated. The governance document context is different from
the tool qualification context, and the analogy is structural,
not functional.

The requalification trigger taxonomy in DO-330 is the
aviation framework's most precise implementation of what
this paper terms an epoch limit: the condition under
which a governance artefact's validity expires and
revalidation is required. The taxonomy, documented in
Pothon et al. (2013), distinguishes three cases:

Unchanged reuse: no requalification if TQL, lifecycle data,
operational environment, tool operating requirements (TOR),
and tool version all remain identical to the previously
qualified configuration.

Operational environment change only: no requalification if
the applicant demonstrates that the new environment is
equivalent and the TOR remain applicable. The burden of
proof is on the applicant; the default is invalidation.

Tool itself changed: requalification is required, scoped
by an impact analysis identifying which aspects of the
prior qualification remain valid and which must be
renewed.

The critical boundary condition: the distinction between
cases requiring requalification and cases not requiring it
is not the presence or absence of change, but whether the
change affects the relationship between tool outputs and
certification objectives. A change that does not alter
that relationship does not require requalification. A
change that does alter it requires requalification
regardless of its apparent magnitude.

The governance implication is direct: the AI governance
document is the artefact whose validity must be context-
bounded. When the deployment context changes in ways that
affect the relationship between the document's governance
claims and the agent's operational behaviour, the document
must be revalidated. DO-330 places the burden of proof on
the applicant to demonstrate contextual equivalence. No
AI governance instrument currently imposes any equivalent
burden.

### 2.3 DO-178C objective evidence architecture

DO-178C's treatment of evidence defines what it means for
a claim to be supported rather than merely asserted.
Evidence must:

- support the certification objectives it is cited for,
  not merely be adjacent to them;
- survive independent review by someone other than the
  person who produced it;
- reconcile with all related lifecycle artefacts without
  contradiction;
- be produced through processes meeting the independence
  and rigour requirements appropriate to the DAL.

The adequacy-versus-presence distinction is explicit in
the standard and in FAA Advisory Circular guidance: the
existence of evidence does not make it sufficient. Evidence
is sufficient when it demonstrates the property it is
claimed to demonstrate under the conditions under which
the claim applies.

DO-178C defines five evidence categories: review records,
analysis records, test records, traceability data, and
process evidence. Each category has defined objectives.
Each objective is associated with independence requirements
that scale with DAL level.

The programme's concept of the proof surface, the
structured set of evidence mechanisms through which
governance claims are verified, is a generalisation of
this architecture to AI governance documents. Where DO-178C
defines the proof surface for a software system's
certification claims, the programme proposes that AI
governance documents must define their own proof surface:
the mechanisms through which their governance claims can
be verified and the feedback loop through which deviations
from those claims are detected and reported.

---

## 3. The Gap

### 3.1 Where the aviation framework breaks down for AI

The aviation certification community has itself identified
where DO-178C fails for AI systems. CoDANN I (EASA, March
2020) and CoDANN II (EASA, May 2021) establish that ML
systems challenge traditional certification because, as
CoDANN II notes, "the link between requirements and
implementation is statistical rather than deterministic."
DO-178C's bidirectional traceability assumes deterministic
behaviour: given the same input, a deterministic system
produces the same output, and that output is either within
or outside the specified behaviour. A neural network trained
on data does not satisfy this assumption. Its behaviour is
not a direct function of its requirements specification.
There is no low-level design traceable from requirements
to source code because the source code is the training
process and the model weights, neither of which is
specified by the requirements document. At inference time,
sampling-based decoding means that even a fixed model
presented with identical inputs does not guarantee identical
outputs. The concept of unambiguous behaviour, central to
both DO-178C's requirements criteria and any governance
document's claim to be actionable, cannot be verified by
the standard test-repeatability method when the system
output is non-deterministic by design.

The absence is confirmed from within the most technically
rigorous regulatory tradition. EUROCAE's ED-324 (in
development, December 2026 target) is the first dedicated
aviation AI governance standard. EASA's NPA 2025-07
proposes trustworthiness AMC/GM for AI in aviation. Neither
specifies a structural completeness criterion for the
governance document governing the AI system. The AIAA
2025-2511 paper (Lincoln, 2025) comes closest in peer-reviewed literature,
arguing that AI requirements must be "clear, concise, and
unambiguous." This addresses requirements quality,
not governance document completeness.

### 3.2 Where the gap appears

The gap is not at the system level. The aviation framework
has been actively developing AI-specific certification
guidance for five years. The gap is at the document level:
no aviation standard, advisory circular, or certification
guidance specifies what must be present in the governance
document (the system prompt, AGENTS.md file, or governance policy) that governs an AI system's behaviour
before deployment.

The three structural requirements that DO-178C and DO-330
impose on software certification artefacts do not appear
in any published AI governance instrument in aviation or
in any other regulated sector. The programme has confirmed
this across nine sectors and five language jurisdictions.

The aviation case is the sharpest illustration because
aviation has the strongest tradition of formal specification
completeness and the most developed methodology for
implementing it. If the three requirements are absent from
the most technically rigorous sector, their absence in less
rigorous sectors follows with certainty.

---

## 4. Three Findings Mapped

### 4.1 Epoch limits on governance document validity

The first finding is that a governance document must carry its
own validity conditions (the circumstances under which its governance claims remain applicable) and that
revalidation is required when those conditions are violated.
For continuously adapting systems, including those using
retrieval-augmented generation or live data integration,
evidence-based and event-based triggers are the appropriate
epoch limit form: for example, "re-evaluate when the
retrieval corpus is updated beyond a defined threshold."
The framework requires declaration of the trigger; it does
not prescribe its form.

DO-330's requalification trigger taxonomy is the most
operationalised epoch limit specification in any regulated
domain. It defines with precision what constitutes a change
requiring revalidation (a change affecting the relationship
between tool outputs and certification objectives), what
constitutes a change not requiring it (a change demonstrably
not affecting that relationship), and who bears the burden
of proof (the applicant, not the certifier).

The programme's P7 principle (Contextual Currency) is the
governance document analogue of this architecture. A
P7-compliant governance document declares: here are the
event-based conditions under which this document's
governance claims expire and revalidation is required; here
is the time-based interval after which revalidation is
required regardless of events; and here is who is responsible
for initiating revalidation.

No current AI governance instrument carries a P7-compliant
staleness declaration. The default is implicit permanent
validity. DO-330 makes the default the opposite: the default
is invalidation, and the applicant must demonstrate
continuing validity. The programme proposes the same
inversion for AI governance documents.

### 4.2 Proof surfaces as the feedback mechanism

The second finding is that a governance document must define
the mechanisms through which its governance claims are
verified: what evidence is required, what makes that
evidence sufficient, and how deviations are fed back into
the governance document's revalidation cycle.

DO-178C's objective evidence architecture is the most
developed proof surface specification in any regulated
sector. Five evidence categories, defined objectives for
each, independence requirements scaled to risk, adequacy-
versus-presence distinction explicit in guidance.

The programme's P5 principle (Quality Gate), extended in
v1.2 to require the document to name the evidence stream
the human can independently access and to require active
rather than passive human engagement, is the governance
document analogue. The quality gate is where the proof
surface is specified at authorship time.

The adequacy-versus-presence distinction has a direct
governance document parallel: a quality gate that says
"review outputs before accepting them" is present but not
adequate. An adequate quality gate specifies what review
means, what criteria outputs are reviewed against, and
what action is required when criteria are not met.

### 4.3 The structural gap confirmed

The third finding is that no regulatory instrument in any
confirmed jurisdiction requires AI governance documents
to meet a structural completeness standard before
deployment.

The aviation case provides the sharpest confirmation
because it is the sector where the absence would be most
surprising. DO-178C has required structural completeness
of software requirements for thirty years. The standard-
setting bodies adapting DO-178C for AI (EASA CoDANN,
EUROCAE ED-324, NPA 2025-07) have acknowledged the
framework's breakdown for AI but have not specified a
structural completeness criterion for the AI governance
document.

ED-324's acknowledged paradigm shift, from DO-178C's
requirements completeness to ODD completeness, from code
traceability to data/model lineage traceability, from
functional determinism to statistical performance bounds,
is a reframing at the system level. It does not address
the governance document level. An AI system whose ODD is
well-defined and whose data lineage is traceable can still
be governed by a system prompt with no success definition,
no quality gate, and no staleness declaration.

The gap is at the layer below the system and above the
model: the natural language document that tells the system
what to do.

The aviation finding is not isolated. A structured
regulatory corpus audit of published governance instruments
across eight further regulated sectors confirms the same
absence. The three structural requirements (linkage, context-bounded validity, and proof surface
specification) appear in none of the sector's primary
governance instruments as requirements for AI governance
documents. The primary instruments and the nature of the
absence in each sector are as follows.

Financial services: SR 11-7 (Federal Reserve, 2011) is the
most mature model governance framework in any sector. It
requires model documentation, independent validation, and
ongoing monitoring with defined performance thresholds for
statistical models. It does not require the governance
document for an LLM-based or agentic system to declare its
own validity conditions or define a proof surface at
authorship time. The monitoring requirement is a process
obligation on the organisation, not a structural requirement
on the document.

Healthcare: the FDA's Predetermined Change Control Plan
(PCCP, 2021 and 2024 guidance) requires manufacturers to
define in advance the types of changes an AI/ML algorithm
may undergo and the performance specifications that trigger
resubmission. This is the closest regulatory analogue to the
epoch limit concept in any sector. The PCCP requirement
applies to the change control plan as an organisational
process document, not to the governance document specifying
the AI system's operating scope before initial deployment.

Nuclear and critical infrastructure: IEC 61508 (functional
safety for electrical, electronic, and programmable
electronic systems) requires a safety case that must remain
valid throughout the operational life of the system, with
defined revalidation triggers when the operating context
changes. This is the most operationally precise epoch limit
requirement in any regulatory instrument. The IAEA safety
case requirements impose the same obligation for nuclear
systems. Neither instrument extends the safety case
validity requirement to the governance documents for AI
systems operating within or adjacent to safety-critical
functions.

Legal and professional services: ABA Formal Opinion 512
(2023) requires lawyers to understand AI tool limitations
and to supervise AI output. The UK Solicitors Regulation
Authority guidance (2024) imposes equivalent obligations.
Both instruments require the practitioner to exercise
professional judgment as a compensating control for AI
output. Neither specifies what structural properties the
governance document for the AI tool must possess to make
that judgment supportable.

Pharmaceutical and life sciences: ICH E9(R1) (2019)
requires clinical trial sponsors to specify precisely what
treatment effect they are estimating and under what
conditions, before the trial begins. GxP computer system
validation requirements (21 CFR Part 11, EU Annex 11)
require documented evidence that validated systems do what
their specifications say. Both instruments address the
specification precision problem directly, in the context
of clinical trial design and computer system validation
respectively. Neither requires AI governance documents to
satisfy structural completeness criteria before deployment.

Insurance and actuarial: the NAIC AI Systems Evaluation
Tool (2023) and the UK PRA Supervisory Statement SS1/23
on model risk management in insurance mirror SR 11-7's
model governance framework for the insurance sector. The
NAIC instrument requires insurers to document governance,
accountability, transparency, and consumer protection for
AI systems. The structural completeness requirement, that
the governance document itself must define what done looks
like, how outputs are verified, and when the document
expires, is not present in either instrument.

Public sector: the Five Eyes guidance "Careful Adoption
of Agentic AI Services" (CISA/NSA/ASD/CCCS/NCSC, May
2026) recommends governance before deployment and human
oversight throughout agentic AI operations in government
contexts. The document explicitly acknowledges that
"evaluation methods are not mature." That acknowledgment
is the absence stated from inside the regulatory community:
the instruments for confirming governance document
completeness before deployment do not yet exist.

Management consulting: no sector-specific regulatory
instrument governs AI governance documents produced by
or for consulting firms. ISO/IEC 42001 is increasingly
referenced as a baseline AI management system standard.
It addresses organisational governance processes, not
the structural properties of individual governance
documents.

Multilingual confirmation: the absence is not limited to
the Anglophone regulatory tradition. A structured audit
of governance instruments in four additional language
jurisdictions confirmed the same pattern. Japan's *AI
Guidelines for Business* Ver 1.2 (METI/MIC, 2026),
France's CNIL AI Self-Assessment Guide (2022), the South
Korean AI Framework Act (enacted January 2025, in force
January 2026), and China's SAC GB/T AI standards series
none of which specify structural completeness requirements
for AI governance documents as a precondition for
deployment. This pattern is consistent across the regulatory traditions
examined in this paper, with the aviation sector receiving the
most detailed treatment.

---

## 5. The Transferable Principles

The aviation framework's failure for AI at the system level
does not invalidate its principles at the governance
document level. The three structural requirements are
applicable to natural language governance documents for
the same reason they are applicable to software
requirements documents: both are specifications that a
conforming agent must be derivable from, and both can fail
in ways that are structural, identifiable, and consequential.

The aviation framework fails at the system level because
AI systems are not deterministic derivations from their
requirements. A neural network cannot be shown to trace
to its requirements the way deterministic code can.

The aviation framework applies at the governance document
level because natural language governance documents can
be evaluated against structural completeness criteria
just as requirements documents can. A system prompt
that has no success definition fails the unambiguous
criterion. A system prompt that has no quality gate fails
the verifiable criterion. A system prompt that carries
no staleness declaration fails the traceability criterion.
These are document-level failures, not system-level
failures, and they are assessable at authorship time.

A sceptic might object that this is no different from any
informal specification, and that informal specifications
have always been incomplete without any certification
machinery to enforce them. The objection misidentifies the
comparison. The relevant precedent is not source code but
the natural language requirements documents that DO-178C
has imposed structural criteria on for three decades.
Those documents are also informal, also human-authored,
and also subject to the same categories of failure:
missing verifiability criteria, undefined scope, internal
contradiction. DO-178C requires structural completeness of
requirements documents precisely because their failures are
detectable at authorship time and consequential at system
level. The same logic applies to AI governance documents,
with one additional force: in a deterministic software
system, a requirements failure can in principle be detected
during implementation when the code cannot be derived from
the underspecified requirement. In a stochastic AI system,
there is no implementation step that forces the failure to
surface. The governance document is the last determinate
artefact in the chain. If it is structurally incomplete,
no subsequent process is guaranteed to catch it.

This is the programme's core claim: PromptQ moves aviation's
structural requirements upstream, from the software
artefacts that must satisfy them to the governance document
that specifies what the software is supposed to do.

A further objection holds that document-level completeness
cannot causally constrain a stochastic runtime. This is
correct, and the framework does not claim otherwise. The
claim is narrower and more defensible: a governance document
that declares its own epoch limits creates an auditable
trigger for human review when those limits are breached. A
document that declares no triggers provides no such mechanism,
regardless of what the runtime does. Unknown unknowns at
authorship time cannot be specified; they are addressed not
by completeness but by the re-evaluation mechanism the
document must declare. When an unknown becomes known through
operational experience, the specification is extended to
incorporate the new learning. This is the Pyrrhonian
inheritance: withhold assent on what cannot yet be known,
but declare the conditions under which assent is warranted.

Where risk warrants it, the governance document can specify
additional mechanisms: anomaly detection thresholds,
runtime audit triggers, performance drift indicators. These
extend the proof surface beyond authorship time without
claiming to close it. No governance architecture, including
DO-178C, provides absolute guarantees. Aviation's assurance
model is not a claim of zero failures; it is a claim that
failures are detectable, traceable, and correctable within
a defined evidence architecture. The same standard applied
at the governance document layer is not weaker than aviation
practice. It is the same practice, applied one level upstream.
Over time, as operational experience accumulates and
unknown unknowns surface, the specification is extended,
the proof surface grows, and the governance architecture
approximates a robust and resilient solution without ever
claiming to have reached one.

## 6. ACAS Xu and the Assumption Epoch Limit

The ACAS X collision avoidance system, specifically the
ACAS Xu variant developed for unmanned aircraft integration
into civilian airspace, provides a concrete example of
aviation's handling of the epoch limit at the system level.
ACAS Xu is a civilian airspace safety system, not a weapons
platform; its assurance methodology is directly applicable
to civil aviation governance contexts. It illustrates an
additional precision that the programme's P7 principle should
incorporate.

ACAS Xu uses a look-up table (LUT) as its specification:
a formal verification that the neural network's output
matches the LUT across the entire input space. This
addresses completeness by verifying the specification-
approximation gap is zero. But the assurance is bounded
by the validity of the LUT's underlying assumptions:
perfect sensors, bounded manoeuvre models, cooperative
intruder assumptions.

The assumption-centric assurance approach treats the assumptions register (the explicit
list of conditions under which the assurance holds) as
the specification. When those assumptions no longer hold,
the epoch expires. When the sensors are imperfect, or the
intruder is non-cooperative, or the manoeuvre bounds are
exceeded, the assurance case is invalid regardless of
whether the neural network still matches the LUT.

This identifies a third type of epoch limit beyond the
time-based and event-based triggers in P7's current
definition: an assumption epoch limit. A governance
document becomes invalid when the foundational assumptions
under which it was written no longer hold, even when no
discrete triggering event has occurred and no calendar
interval has elapsed. A P7-complete governance document
should declare its foundational assumptions alongside its
staleness declaration.

The assumption-based trigger is a proposed research
direction. It is less mature than the time-based and
event-based triggers, which have clear operational
precedents in aviation certification practice. Formalising
the assumption epoch limit requires a taxonomy of
governance document assumption types, monitoring
mechanisms, and invalidation thresholds. The ACAS Xu
case provides the assurance-structure motivation; the
operational specification is a direction for further work.

The epoch limit concept is derived from the structural
principle that assumptions have validity boundaries, not
from ACAS Xu's specific algorithmic mechanism. ACAS Xu
illustrates the principle in a deterministic system; the
governance document application extends it to the
authorship-time artefact layer where the analogous
mechanism is human review triggered by declared conditions
rather than algorithmic state transition.

## 7. Implications for AI Governance Practice

The aviation case provides three actionable implications
for AI governance practice.

First: governance documents should be treated as
certification artefacts, not operational instructions.
DO-178C treats the requirements document as a first-class
artefact with its own quality criteria, completeness
requirements, and traceability obligations. AI governance
practitioners should apply the same standard to the
documents that govern AI system behaviour.

Second: the burden of proof for continuing validity should
be on the deployer, not the certifier. DO-330 makes
invalidation the default; demonstrating continuing validity
requires active argument. AI governance practice has the
opposite default: deployment is assumed valid until
something goes wrong. The aviation inversion (assume invalid, demonstrate valid) is the appropriate default
for high-stakes AI systems.

Third: evidence architecture should be specified at
authorship time, not assembled retrospectively at audit.
DO-178C requires that evidence categories and objectives
be defined as part of the development process. The evidence
is produced as the system is built. AI governance practice
typically assembles evidence after deployment when
compliance is questioned. Defining the proof surface at
authorship time: what evidence will demonstrate
compliance, what makes that evidence sufficient, how
deviations will be fed back. This is the aviation model
transferred to AI governance.

The assurance case tradition provides established notation
for this (Bloomfield and Bishop, 2010). Goal Structuring
Notation (Kelly and Weaver, 2004) is the standard method for expressing structured
arguments that a system is safe with respect to a given
set of requirements, linking claims through explicit
inference rules to a defined evidence base. An AI
governance document that declares its proof surface is
making the same structural move: it specifies the claims,
the inference structure connecting those claims to
evidence, and the evidence required to make each claim
hold. The difference is that GSN was developed for
safety-critical systems engineering. The concept of a
proof surface in this paper is closely related to GSN's
evidence layer; the novel contribution is the requirement
that individual AI governance documents declare their own
proof surface at authorship time, rather than having it
constructed retrospectively as part of a system-level
safety argument. The proposal is to require this
structure in the natural language governance documents
that precede any engineering, not to reproduce GSN as
a notation system.

## 8. Related Work

The gap between DO-178C's requirements and AI system
assurance has been studied in the CoDANN I (EASA, 2020)
and CoDANN II (EASA, 2021) literature. These documents
establish the breakdown of the traditional certification
model for learning systems. The ED-324 standard in
development (EUROCAE, target December 2026) is the primary
ongoing standardisation response.

The ACAS Xu assumption-centric assurance approach is
documented in Damour et al. (2021, SAFECOMP), Gabreau
et al. (2022, ERTS), and Gabreau, Teulières et al.
(2024, ERTS). These papers represent the most
developed technical work on assumption-bounded AI
certification in aviation.

The programme's companion paper (arXiv:2604.21090) established
that 37% of AI governance documents fall below a structural
quality threshold measured against the five-principle diagnostic
model. Applying a seven-principle extension of this framework,
adding P6 (Internal Consistency) and P7 (Contextual Currency),
to the same 34-file corpus (the governance-prompts-v1 empirical
corpus) yields the following results.

The table below shows mean scores by principle across the
34-file corpus under the seven-principle extension. 94% of
files (32/34) score below the 3.5/7 threshold.

| P6 Internal Consistency | 0.60 |
| P7 Contextual Currency | 0.00 |

The P7 finding is the most significant result in the programme.
Every governance document in the 34-file corpus scores zero on
Contextual Currency. Not a single document declares any
staleness trigger (event-based, time-based, or evidence-based).
The score is 0.00 with zero variance, confirmed across five
independent raters from two model families. The corpus
represents real-world practice: no practitioner in the
evaluated corpus has specified
when their governance document expires. This is the empirical
basis for the theoretical claim this paper develops: the
absence of epoch limit declarations is not an edge case in
production AI governance; it is the norm.

The increase from 37% (five-principle) to 94% (32/34) (seven-principle)
is structural. P7 contributes 0 to every file; P6 adds up to
1 point of exposure; the higher threshold (3.5/7 versus
2.5/5) reflects the extended ceiling. The five-principle rate
remains valid as a lower bound for the P1-P5 failure profile.
The seven-principle rate captures the full structural gap
including the epoch limit dimension this paper addresses.

Concurrent work on evidentiary AI governance frameworks
includes OpenKedge (He and Yu, arXiv:2604.08601, 2026)
and Koch and Wellbrock (arXiv:2604.19818, 2026). These
papers address the runtime evidence layer; this paper
addresses the authorship-time specification layer.

## 9. Conclusion

Aviation software certification has required structured
governance linkage, context-bounded validity, and an objective
evidence architecture for three decades. These requirements
have made aviation software among the most reliable in any
safety-critical domain.

No equivalent requirements apply to the governance documents
that specify AI system behaviour. The aviation certification
community has acknowledged that its existing frameworks break
down for AI systems at the system level, and the standards
being developed to address that breakdown have not yet
specified structural completeness requirements for AI
governance documents. This absence is indicated across nine
regulated sectors by a structured regulatory corpus audit;
the aviation sector provides the sharpest instance because
it has the most technically rigorous specification tradition.

The paper's primary claim is that aviation's structural
requirements are transferable to AI governance documents at
the document level, even though they cannot be transferred
to AI systems at the system level. A governance document is
a static authorship-time artifact. Its structural properties
can be evaluated and required independently of the stochastic
system it governs. The seven-principle PromptQ framework is
the methodological operationalisation of that transfer.

A circularity limitation applies to the empirical results.
The PromptQ instrument was designed by the author; using it
to score a corpus and find a gap does not independently
validate the instrument. Three mitigants are noted. First,
each of the seven principles is grounded in an established
external tradition: safety engineering (P1, P3, P5), measurement
theory (P2, P4), and organisational theory (P5, P6, P7),
providing independent theoretical justification for why each
property is required. Second, the P7 finding (zero documents
declare any staleness trigger across five independent models
from two model families) is consistent regardless of the
scorer's leniency gradient, and holds under per-principle
scoring modes that suppress holistic evaluation bias. Third,
the three structural requirements identified in Section 2
are derived from aviation certification practice, not from
PromptQ. PromptQ operationalises a pre-existing standard,
it does not define it. Independent empirical validation of
PromptQ against established requirements engineering metrics
is potential future work.

The absence of equivalent requirements in AI governance
reflects a policy choice not to require even the structurally
feasible completeness properties that aviation's tradition
identifies. Whether governance documents can achieve full
DO-178C-equivalent traceability at scale remains an open
research question requiring formalism not yet developed for
natural language artifacts. The paper argues only that the
structural principle is transferable and the absence is not
inevitable.

Risk-proportionate application is the appropriate target.
DO-178C's Design Assurance Level structure scales evidence
requirements with hazard severity: DAL A for catastrophic
failure, DAL E for no safety effect. Governance document
completeness requirements should scale similarly. The PromptQ
framework's graduated score (0-7) provides the natural
substrate for risk-tiered minimum thresholds. The table
below proposes provisional thresholds; precise calibration
requires empirical grounding and is a primary direction
for further work.

**Table:** *Provisional risk-proportionate PromptQ minimum score thresholds.*

| Risk tier | Indicative minimum PromptQ score | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Prohibited (EU AI Act) | Not applicable | Document completeness cannot substitute for prohibition |
| High risk (EU AI Act Annex III; NIST critical) | 6/7; P1, P3, P5, P7 mandatory | All staleness triggers required; scope boundary mandatory |
| Limited risk (EU AI Act transparency obligations) | 4/7; P1, P3 mandatory | Success definition and scope boundary are the minimum viable properties |
| Minimal risk | 3.5/7; no mandatory principles | Programme corpus threshold |

The empirical corpus shows that 94% of current practitioner
documents fall below 3.5/7; a high-risk threshold of 6/7
would be failed by every document in the corpus. Whether
this reflects a calibration problem or a real governance
gap is itself a research question that requires outcome
data linking document scores to governance failures.
